# Tkinter Exercises for VIBOT - Computer Science: Python TD3

This repository contains a series of 7 exercises developed during the first semester of the VIBOT master's program in the Computer Science: Python course. Each exercise is designed to practice and enhance skills in creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Tkinter, a standard GUI library for Python. The exercises range from basic GUI elements to more complex applications, including a simple calculator.

## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise 1: User Information Interface
Create a graphical interface that prompts the user to enter their name, first name, and date of birth. Upon submission, it displays a message with the entered information.

### Exercise 2: Current Time Display
Develop a GUI that shows the current time when a button labeled 'current time' is clicked.

### Exercise 3: Dynamic Circle Drawer
Construct a window containing a canvas and four buttons. These buttons allow the user to draw circles with random properties, change the color of the paths, and clear the canvas.

### Exercise 4: Color Chooser Combo Widget
Build a graphical window with a combo widget that lets users select or input a color. This color then becomes the background color of the master window.

### Exercise 5: Olympic Rings
a) Create a program to draw the 10 Olympic rings. Include a "Quit" button to close the window.
b) Modify the program to draw each of the 5 Olympic rings with separate buttons.

### Exercise 6: Gravitational Force Simulation
Write a program that simulates the gravitational force between two stars represented by circles. Include the functionality to move the stars and display their distance and the gravitational force between them.

### Exercise 7: Simple Calculator
Program a simple calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and calculating the square root. Include a clear button to reset calculations.

## How to Run the Exercises

Each exercise is contained within its own Python file, named `Exercise_1.py` through `Exercise_7.py`. To run an exercise, simply execute the corresponding file in your Python environment:

```bash
python Exercise_1.py
```
Replace Exercise_1.py with the desired exercise number to run a different exercise.

## Requirements
  Python 3.x
  Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
